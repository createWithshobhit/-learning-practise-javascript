1. JavaScript Basics:
Syntax and Comments:
Definition: Syntax is the set of rules that define how JavaScript programs are constructed. Comments are lines that are ignored by the interpreter and are used to explain the code.
Example:

js
Copy code
// Single-line comment
/* Multi-line
   comment */
let x = 10; // This is a statement
console.log(x); // Output: 10
Variables & Constants:
Definition: Variables are used to store data. var, let, and const are used to declare variables, with const for constant values and let/var for reassignable ones.
Example:

js
Copy code
var name = "John"; // Can be re-declared
let age = 25; // Block-scoped, can be reassigned
const pi = 3.14; // Cannot be reassigned
Data Types (Primitive and Non-Primitive):
Definition: JavaScript has primitive types (like numbers, strings, booleans) and non-primitive types (like objects, arrays).
Example:

js
Copy code
// Primitive types
let num = 42;           // Number
let str = "Hello";      // String
let isActive = true;    // Boolean

// Non-primitive type
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }; // Object
Operators:
Definition: Operators perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
Example:

js
Copy code
let sum = 5 + 3; // Arithmetic: 8
let isEqual = 5 === '5'; // Comparison: false
let isValid = true && false; // Logical: false
Control Flow (if/else, switch):
Definition: Control flow structures, such as if, else if, and switch, direct the order in which the code executes.
Example:

js
Copy code
let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
} else {
    console.log("Not an adult");
}

let color = "green";
switch (color) {
    case "red":
        console.log("Stop");
        break;
    case "green":
        console.log("Go");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown color");
}
Loops:
Definition: Loops allow us to run the same block of code multiple times (for, while, do...while).
Example:

js
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2
}

let j = 0;
while (j < 3) {
    console.log(j); // Output: 0, 1, 2
    j++;
}
Functions:
Definition: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task and can be called whenever needed.
Example:

js
Copy code
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
console.log(greet("John")); // Output: Hello, John
2. Intermediate JavaScript Topics:
Function Scope and Closures:
Definition (Scope): Defines the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects.
Definition (Closures): A closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created, even after that environment has gone.
Example:

js
Copy code
function outer() {
    let outerVar = "I'm outside!";
    return function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar); // Closure: Accessing outerVar
    };
}
const innerFunc = outer();
innerFunc(); // Output: I'm outside!
Hoisting:
Definition: JavaScript hoists variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before executing code. Variables declared with let and const are not initialized, so they exist in the "temporal dead zone" until their actual declaration.
Example:

js
Copy code
console.log(hoistedVar); // Output: undefined (var is hoisted)
var hoistedVar = 5;

hoistedFunc(); // Output: "Function hoisted!"
function hoistedFunc() {
    console.log("Function hoisted!");
}
JavaScript Objects:
Definition: Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They can store various data types, including functions (called methods).
Example:

js
Copy code
let car = {
    brand: "Tesla",
    model: "Model S",
    start() {
        console.log("Car started");
    }
};
console.log(car.brand); // Access property: Tesla
car.start(); // Access method: Car started
Arrays:
Definition: Arrays are ordered collections of values, which can hold multiple values under a single variable.
Example:

js
Copy code
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple

fruits.push("orange"); // Adds an element
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]
Event Handling (Browser):
Definition: JavaScript can handle events triggered by user actions (like clicks, keypresses) on a web page.
Example:

html
Copy code
<button id="myButton">Click me!</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
      alert("Button clicked!");
  });
</script>
Error Handling (try/catch):
Definition: Error handling allows you to gracefully manage exceptions using try, catch, and finally blocks.
Example:

js
Copy code
try {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message); // Output: Something went wrong
} finally {
    console.log("Clean-up code");
}
Promises and Asynchronous JavaScript:
Definition: Promises handle asynchronous operations by representing an operation that is completed (resolved) or failed (rejected).
Example:

js
Copy code
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
});
promise.then(result => console.log(result)); // Output after 1 second: Success!
3. Advanced JavaScript Topics:
ES6+ Features (Template literals, Destructuring, Spread/Rest, Classes):
Definition: Modern JavaScript (ES6+) introduces new features like template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, and classes.
Example:

js
Copy code
// Template literals
let name = "John";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}`); // Output: Hello, John

// Destructuring
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
let { name: personName, age } = person;
console.log(personName); // Output: Alice

// Spread operator
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
let newNums = [...nums, 4, 5]; // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Class
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
    }
}
const alice = new Person("Alice", 25);
alice.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
Closures (in-depth):
Definition: A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function, even after the outer function has executed.
Example:

js
Copy code
function counter() {
    let count = 0;
    return function () {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
}
const increment = counter();
console.log(increment()); // Output: 1
console.log(increment()); // Output: 2
Async/Await:
Definition: async/await is syntactic sugar built on promises to handle asynchronous code in a more readable way.
Example:

js
Copy code
async function fetchData() {
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
fetchData(); // Logs the fetched data
Generators and Iterators:
Definition (Generators): A generator is a function that can pause its execution and resume later.
Definition (Iterators): Iterators are objects that can be iterated over (like arrays, strings).
Example:

js
Copy code
function* generator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}
let gen = generator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // Output: 2
Proxies and Reflection:
Definition (Proxies): Proxies allow you to intercept and redefine fundamental operations on objects.
Definition (Reflection): Reflect provides methods for intercepting JavaScript operations (like object property lookup or function invocation).
Example:

js
Copy code
let target = { message: "Hello" };
let handler = {
    get: function (obj, prop) {
        return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : "Property not found";
    }
};
let proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
console.log(proxy.message); // Output: Hello
console.log(proxy.notExist); // Output: Property not found
4. Most Advanced JavaScript Topics:
Event Loop and Microtasks:
Definition: The event loop allows JavaScript to execute asynchronous code by handling events and callbacks when the call stack is empty.
Example:

js
Copy code
console.log('Script start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('setTimeout'), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
console.log('Script end');
// Output: Script start, Script end, Promise, setTimeout
Functional Programming (FP):
Definition: FP is a paradigm where programs are built by applying and composing pure functions without mutating data.
Example:

js
Copy code
let double = n => n * 2;
let nums = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = nums.map(double); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
WebSockets:
Definition: WebSockets allow for real-time communication between a client (browser) and server over a single, long-lived connection.
Example:

js
Copy code
let socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket");
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log(event.data);
};
